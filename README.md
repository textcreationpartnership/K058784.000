1. REASONS For not Replying to Mr. WALTON's FULL ANSWER, &c.
I. THERE are ſome Men that can neither give nor take an Anſwer, but writing merely for the ſake of wII. AT firſt I conſider'd him in another light, as one who had good reaſon for keeping to the beatenIII. MR. Walton indeed after his free manner calls my Analyſt a Libel. Vindication, p. 1. But this iIV.
